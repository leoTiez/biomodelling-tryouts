# Reproducing Biomodelling Approaches

This readme and repository is in process, so it's still
not giving a good introduction. An update is coming soon.
Yet anybody is welcome to clone the repository and to play
around a little yourself. It's required to use `python3` and
to have pip3 installed. To install the requirements run

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements
``` 

Also, the project's structure makes it necessary to add it to 
the `PYTHONPATH` variable. Simply run 

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/project
```

where `path/to/project` is replaced by the actual path to 
the project's root directory.
